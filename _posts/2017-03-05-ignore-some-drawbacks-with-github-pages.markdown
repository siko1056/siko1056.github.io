The situation
[I described last year]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2016-11-13-some-drawbacks-with-github-pages.markdown %})
did not change,
but I noticed that the extra effort required for writing a new post
discouraged me to continue this blog.
By returning to the usual GitHub pages workflow
the situation might hopefully change.
