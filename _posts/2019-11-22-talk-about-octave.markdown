At the
[Shibaura Institute of Technology](http://www.web.se.shibaura-it.ac.jp/mathsci/04-01.html)
I was given the opportunity to talk about GNU Octave.

The topics covered are:
- A brief introduction to GNU Octave (history, community)
- Installation on MS Windows 10
- Octave demonstrations (data I/O, plotting, m-code optimization,
  Fortran interface)
- Brief overview of Octave development
- Reporting bugs and getting help

All material, including the slides, are
[available on GitHub](https://github.com/octave-de/octave_slides/releases/tag/2019-11-22).
