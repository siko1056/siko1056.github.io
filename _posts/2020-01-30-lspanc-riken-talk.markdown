My [slides](https://github.com/siko1056/slides_LSPANC_2020/)
and [the white-paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04628)
of the
"Workshop on Large-scale Parallel Numerical Computing Technology"
([LSPANC 2020](https://www.r-ccs.riken.jp/labs/lpnctrt/lspanc2020jan/))
at RIKEN.

The talk deals with the question,
how to setup **my software** (with many dependencies) on **other peoples** systems.
Two promising, with limitations combinable, tools are motivated:
- [spack](https://spack.io/) --- the *Supercomputing Package manager*
- [singularity](https://sylabs.io/) --- lightweight HPC container virtualization
