While reading the
[system journal](https://doc.opensuse.org/documentation/leap/reference/html/book.opensuse.reference/cha.journalctl.html)
of my server,
I noticed a bunch of evil looking entries
and finally found in the Python tool [fail2ban](https://www.fail2ban.org/)
a satisfying but not an overall answer to the problem.

The system journal can be inspected by:

```
$ sudo journalctl -r

```

Two hosts (later I noticed a few more),
lets call them `XXX.XX.X.XXX` and `YY.YYY.YY.YY` for now,
are permanently trying to log in to my server as root.

Using an arbitrary
[IP-Address lookup service](https://www.whatismyip.com/ip-address-lookup/),
I was told be attacked from hosts in Asia.
The country was reported as well,
but it does not matter for this blog post.
In my opinion the worth of this information is doubtful anyways.


But for now,
I write about what I did and what prevented greater damage so far:

A good decision at server setup was to only permit logins via
[public-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography)
and not passwords.
Especially `root` should **never** be able to login by a plain `ssh` command!
To achieve this,
the following entries are set in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

```
PermitRootLogin no
PubkeyAuthentication yes
PasswordAuthentication no
```

This is in my opinion the most important layer of defense
against brute force attacks.
But as my system journal reveals,
this is by far not enough.
I don't want my server to waste time with brute force attacks.
It should simply ignore any communication with them.

A promising approach without writing black- or whitelists on my own
is the Python software [fail2ban](https://www.fail2ban.org/).
Like the name suggests,
too many failed login attempts (= brute force attacks) automatically
result in a permanent ban from my server.
In general I consulted three sources for the *fail2ban* setup:

* <https://www.2daygeek.com/how-to-install-setup-configure-fail2ban-on-linux/>
* <https://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/HOWTOs>
* <https://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/MANUAL_0_8>

First one has to install the software.
*openSUSE* makes this task pretty comfortable by typing


```
sudo zypper in fail2ban
```

Then I edited as `root` the configuration file `/etc/fail2ban/jail.local`:

```
# Do all your modifications to the jail's configuration in jail.local!

[DEFAULT]
bantime = 1d

# SSH servers
[sshd]
enabled = true
port    = ssh
logpath = %(sshd_log)s
backend = %(sshd_backend)s
```

and finally started the already available service:

```
sudo systemctl start fail2ban.service
```

Now each suspicious login behavior will result in a one day `1d` ban.
To verify this theory,
there are several ways to check.
The first method is to read the *fail2ban* log:

```
$ sudo cat /var/log/fail2ban.log

```

Et voil√†,
`XXX.XX.X.XXX` and `YY.YYY.YY.YY` misbehaved and were banned! :smile:
To get even more trust and understanding in the *fail2ban* mechanism,
one can take a look at
[iptables](https://doc.opensuse.org/documentation/leap/security/html/book.security/cha.security.firewall.html#sec.security.firewall.iptables),
the system tool,
where *fail2ban* adds appropriate entries:

```
$ sudo iptables -L

...
Chain f2b-sshd (1 references)
target  prot  opt  source        destination
REJECT  all   --   YY.YYY.YY.YY  anywhere    reject-with icmp-port-unreachable
REJECT  all   --   XXX.XX.X.XXX  anywhere    reject-with icmp-port-unreachable
...
```

My system is of no such importance,
that I dare write about this attack to learn from it.
Maybe (and in case of critical systems hopefully) other system administrators
know better
and can teach me how to cope with such a delicate and mean situation.

All in all I hope not to be part of a botnet or similar right now
and that attackers no longer find my sever to be a patient listener :wink:
