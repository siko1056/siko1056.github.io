The slides of today's talk at the
[OctConf2017](http://wiki.octave.org/OctConf_2017)
at [CERN](https://indico.cern.ch/event/609833/timetable/#20170320.detailed)
are available [here](https://github.com/siko1056/OctConf2017).

The talk was about GNU Octave's
[publish](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/doc/interpreter/XREFpublish.html)
and
[grabcode](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/doc/interpreter/XREFgrabcode.html)
functions, that I implemented last year and showed some application in
combination with the
[MediaWiki action API]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2017-03-10-getting-to-know-the-mediawiki-api %}).
