> Created: 2019-12-24

This Christmas I had the honor to give a
[seminar talk at the University of Tokyo](https://na.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/mepa/?page_id=1689),
which was organized by
[JSIAM](https://www2.jsiam.org/en/).

The talk is an extension of a

given in Tokyo.

The topics covered are:
- A brief introduction to GNU Octave (history, community)
- Octave demonstrations (data I/O, plotting, m-code optimization)
- Object-oriented programming with Octave
- Package creation
- oct-files (call Fortran/C/C++ code from Octave)
- Using GNU Octave from C/C++ applications
- Introduction to Octave development
- Reporting bugs and getting help

All material, including the slides, are
[available on GitHub](https://github.com/octave-de/octave_slides/releases/tag/2019-12-24).
